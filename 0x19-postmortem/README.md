Date: 10th June, 2023. Duration: 2hrs: 10mins: 10secs

Summary:

On the 10th June, 2023, our system was unable handle high traffic that resulted in a complete disruption of service. The outage lasted for exactly 2hrs: 10mins: 10secs, during which time our servers were unable to handle the high volume of incoming trafficswhich later lead to temporary site down . This postmortem aims to provide a detailed analysis of the incident, its root causes, and the steps taken to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

Timeline of Events:

00:10:40 : The system started experiencing a sudden surge in incoming traffics. 01:52:05 : The server's CPU utilization increases.The server reached its maximum capacity, causing the system to become unresponsive.The incident was detected by the monitoring system, and the response team was alerted. 02:10:30 : The response team initiated investigations to identify the cause of the issue. 02:36:01 : Steps were taken to distribute the incoming traffic across multiple servers to balance the load. 02:45:57 : The server load got balanced, and the system started recovering. 02:59:58 : The system was fully restored, and normal operations resumed.

Root Causes:

Unexpected Traffic Surge: The outage was triggered by an unforeseen spike in incoming traffic. This surge overwhelmed the server's capacity to handle requests efficiently and effectively. The root cause analysis revealed that the increase in traffic was due to a combination of factors, including a successful marketing campaign, a sudden influx of new users, and an increase in bot activity.

Insufficient Scalability Planning: Our system was not adequately prepared to handle the sudden increase in traffic. The infrastructure lacked the necessary scalability measures to dynamically adjust server resources based on the demand. As a result, the system quickly reached its maximum capacity, leading to performance degradation and eventual failure.

Inefficient Resource Allocation: The server resources were not optimally allocated, which exacerbated the impact of the traffic surge. Certain processes and services were consuming excessive resources, leaving limited capacity for handling incoming requests. This imbalance created a bottleneck, further contributing to the server overload.

Mitigation and Preventive Measures:

Scalability Enhancements: To address the insufficient scalability planning, we have implemented changes to our infrastructure. This includes the deployment of an auto-scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts server resources based on demand. Additionally, we have expanded our server capacity to accommodate anticipated traffic spikes.

Load Testing and Performance Optimization: We have revised our load testing procedures to simulate realistic scenarios and identify potential performance bottlenecks. By conducting regular load tests, we can proactively identify system limitations, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall performance.

Traffic Management and Rate Limiting: To handle sudden traffic surges, we have implemented traffic management techniques, such as rate limiting and request throttling. This allows us to control the incoming traffic, prioritize critical requests, and prevent overload situations.

Monitoring and Alerting: We have enhanced our monitoring systems to provide real-time insights into server performance, capacity utilization, and incoming traffic patterns. This enables early detection of anomalies, allowing us to respond swiftly to potential overload situations.

Incident Response and Escalation: We have refined our incident response procedures to ensure a swift and coordinated response during critical incidents. Clear escalation paths, defined roles and responsibilities, and improved communication channels have been established to minimize downtime and facilitate prompt resolution.

Conclusion: The server overload outage served as a valuable learning experience for our team. We have implemented various measures to mitigate similar incidents in the future, focusing on scalability, performance optimization, traffic management, and enhanced monitoring. By continuously monitoring and refining our systems, we aim to provide seamless connection and great customer service.
